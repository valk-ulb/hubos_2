# HubOS 2.0 - Devs Documentation

<!--## Description-->

This README is intended to provide developers with a clear and structured understanding of how the application is designed, built, and operated.

It explains the overall architecture of an application, and its modules, and the logic of TABAC rules, with a particular focus on how those rules are implemented and enforced within the system.

The document serves as a practical guide for:
- Understanding the purpose and scope of the application
- Identifying and navigating the different modules and services
- Learning how TABAC rules are modeled, validated, and applied
- Setting up a development environment and extending the application safely
- Maintaining consistency with regulatory constraints and business logic

Rather than acting as a full technical specification, this documentation aims to bridge the gap between business requirements and technical implementation, allowing any developer joining the project to quickly understand:
- How to create an application,
- How to create TABAC rules, and
- how those rules interact with the codebase.

By following this documentation, developers should be able to create new application or new features, adjust regulatory logic, or refactor existing components while preserving compliance, security, and architectural coherence.

>[!NOTE]
> To gain a deeper understanding of this project and how it operates, it is strongly recommended to read the associated [master’s thesis](www.example.com) that led to the creation of this system.
